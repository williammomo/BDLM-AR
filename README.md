Supporting information for the manuscript “Analysis of N-of-1 trial using Bayesian distributed lag model with autocorrelated errors” by Ziwei Liao, Min Qian, Ian M. Kronish and Ying Kuen Cheung. All code is written in R and was based on R version 3.5. Required packages are listed at the beginning of the R file.

# Overview

Code is organized into two folders, “Methods” and “Simulation”.
The “Methods” folder contains the code to run the proposed method using a hybrid MH/Gibbs algorithm. Other related functions are also included.

Script “BDLM-AR Methods main.R” contains the main function "MCMC.sampler" to run the proposed method.

The “Simulation” folder contains code to run the simulations in Section 4 and also plots of simulation results.
